\title{Get the possible next tokens and their log probabilities based on the
previous context using a causal transformer}
\usage{
causal_next_tokens_pred_tbl(
  context,
  log.p = getOption("pangoling.log.p"),
  decode = FALSE,
  model = getOption("pangoling.causal.default"),
  checkpoint = NULL,
  add_special_tokens = NULL,
  config_model = NULL,
  config_tokenizer = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{context}{The context.}

\item{log.p}{Base of the logarithm used for the output predictability values.
If \code{TRUE} (default), the natural logarithm (base \emph{e}) is used.
If \code{FALSE}, the raw probabilities are returned.
Alternatively, \code{log.p} can be set to a numeric value specifying
the base of the logarithm (e.g., \code{2} for base-2 logarithms).
To get surprisal in bits (rather than predictability), set
\code{log.p = 1/2}.}

\item{decode}{Should it decode the tokens into readable strings? This is
relevant for special characters such as accents and
diacritics, which get mangled in the tokens.}

\item{model}{Name of a pre-trained model or folder. One should be able to use
models based on "gpt2". See
\href{https://huggingface.co/models?other=gpt2}{hugging face website}.}

\item{checkpoint}{Folder of a checkpoint.}

\item{add_special_tokens}{Whether to include special tokens. It has the
same default as the
\href{https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.25.1/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoTokenizer}{AutoTokenizer}
method in Python.}

\item{config_model}{List with other arguments that control how the
model from Hugging Face is accessed.}

\item{config_tokenizer}{List with other arguments that control how the
tokenizer from Hugging Face is accessed.}
}
\value{
A table with possible next tokens and their log-probabilities.
}

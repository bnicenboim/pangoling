\title{Self-Paced Reading Dataset on Chinese Relative Clauses}
\format{
A tibble with 8,624 rows and 15 variables:
\describe{
\item{subject}{Participant identifier, a character vector.}
\item{item}{Trial item number, an integer.}
\item{cond}{Experimental condition, a character vector indicating variations in sentence structure (e.g., "a", "b", "c", "d").}
\item{word}{Chinese word presented in each trial, a character vector.}
\item{wordn}{Position of the word within the sentence, an integer.}
\item{rt}{Reaction time in milliseconds for reading each word, an integer.}
\item{region}{Sentence region or phrase type (e.g., "hd1", "Det+CL"), a character vector.}
\item{question}{Comprehension question associated with the trial, a character vector.}
\item{accuracy}{Binary accuracy score for the comprehension question (1 = correct, 0 = incorrect).}
\item{correct_answer}{Expected correct answer for the comprehension question, a character vector ("Y" or "N").}
\item{question_type}{Type of comprehension question, a character vector.}
\item{experiment}{Name of the experiment, indicating self-paced reading, a character vector.}
\item{list}{Experimental list number, for counterbalancing item presentation, an integer.}
\item{sentence}{Full sentence used in the trial with words marked for analysis, a character vector.}
\item{surprisal}{Model-derived surprisal values for each word, a numeric vector.}
}

\strong{Region codes in the dataset (column \code{region})}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{N}: Main clause subject (in object-modifications only)
\item \strong{V}: Main clause verb (in object-modifications only)
\item \strong{Det+CL}: Determiner+classifier
\item \strong{Adv}: Adverb
\item \strong{VN}: RC-verb+RC-object (subject relatives) or RC-subject+RC-verb (object relatives)
\itemize{
\item Note: These two words were merged into one region after the experiment; they were presented as separate regions during the experiment.
}
\item \strong{FreqP}: Frequency phrase/durational phrase
\item \strong{DE}: Relativizer "de"
\item \strong{head}: Relative clause head noun
\item \strong{hd1}: First word after the head noun
\item \strong{hd2}: Second word after the head noun
\item \strong{hd3}: Third word after the head noun
\item \strong{hd4}: Fourth word after the head noun (only in subject-modifications)
\item \strong{hd5}: Fifth word after the head noun (only in subject-modifications)
}

\strong{Notes on reading times (column \code{rt})}:
\itemize{
\item The reading time of the relative clause region (e.g., "V-N" or "N-V") was computed by summing up the reading times of the relative clause verb and noun.
\item The verb and noun were presented as two separate regions during the experiment.

\usage{
data(df_jaeger14)
}
\description{
This dataset contains data from a self-paced reading experiment on Chinese
relative clause comprehension. It is structured to support analysis of reaction
times, comprehension accuracy, and surprisal values across various experimental
conditions in a 2x2 fully crossed factorial design:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Factor I}: Modification type (subject modification; object modification)
\item \strong{Factor II}: Relative clause type (subject relative; object relative)
}

\strong{Condition labels}:
\itemize{
\item a) subject modification; subject relative
\item b) subject modification; object relative
\item c) object modification; subject relative
\item d) object modification; object relative

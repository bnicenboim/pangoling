\title{Self-Paced Reading Dataset on Chinese Relative Clauses}
\format{
A tibble with 4,608 rows and 14 variables:
\describe{
\item{subject}{Participant identifier, a character vector.}
\item{item}{Trial item number, an integer.}
\item{cond}{Experimental condition, a character vector indicating variations in sentence structure.}

\description{
This dataset contains data from a self-paced reading experiment on Chinese
relative clause comprehension. It is structured to support analysis of reaction
times and comprehension accuracy across various experimental conditions.
